## Optimised code for a marketing agency, that follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. 
This project was done to create a more accessible page that has descriptive images and can be easily found in search engines. I learned how to use the article and section tags. 
I also learned how to use the inspect tool in Google Chrome to figure out what needs to be altered in my code. 


## Usage

use the navigation headings in the header to navigate to the part of the webpage you would like to read.
